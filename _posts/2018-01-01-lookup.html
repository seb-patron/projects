          About this Project
     </p>

     <p class=" mt5 serif fw1 lh-copy f5 dark-gray measure">
               Prague is a beautiful city. Everywhere you look awe inspiring architecture dominates the skyline.
               The people of Prague however, choose to always look down at the ground. This project is meant to
               celebrate the beauty of the skys and architecture of Prague, and remind those around to always look up.
               All photos were taken with a Ricoh GR II and developed in Lightroom.
